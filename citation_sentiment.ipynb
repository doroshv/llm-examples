    "# Citation validity assessement with local Graph RAG (Ollama + langchain)\n",
    "\n",
    "Years of serving as a reviewer have taught me that people tend to be rather sloppy with citations. It is common both to omit essential citations (either because authors are not familiar with the literature to sufficient extent or other reasons), but also to cite irrelevant papers just to get some self-citations or boost collegues citation record. Moreover, sometimes cited papers are relevant but do not actually support conclusions by the authors, and that's the worst case in my opinion. Simply due to the fact that to do proper review the referee must theoretically read all this body of literature, which is sometimes tedious (especially if the field is not totally aligned with referee's expertise). In this project I try to deal with this case, namely the goals are to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) extract citations from a given (arbitrary) article\n",
    "2) determine why they are cited by the authors (according to authors)\n",
    "3) check whether the reasons for citation align with the conclusions of the cited papers themselves (sentiment analysis)\n",
    "\n",
    "The nature of the project is educational hence I'd like to try to do all of this with local software to avoid paying for services (even if a few cents) and to check how good can small local models be. Obviously, production solution would probably tap to larger LLMs/more sophisticated techniques/prompts. It would also require modifications to agentic part as I'm tailoring the project to astrophysical papers and hence use NASA's ADS system which is not that great for other fields.\n",

    "To start with, let us import some libraries, define some functions to work with ADS's pdfs, and the paper to be analyzed:"

It is found that the magnetic coupling between the star and the plasma in the outer transition zone is appreciable; that as a result, the spin-up torque on fast rotators is substantially less than that on slow rotators, and that for sufficiently high stellar angular velocities or sufficiently low mass accretion rates, the rotation of the star can be braked while accretion continues. These results are applied to pulsating X-ray sources, revealing that at high luminosities a star of given spin period rotating in the same direction as the disk can experience either spin-up or spin-down, depending on its luminosity. Also considered are the general problem of interpreting period changes in pulsating X-ray sources, and the dipole magnetic moments of nine pulsating X-ray sources are estimated by fitting the theoretical spin-up equation to estimates of the average luminosity and spin-up rate of each source.</td>\n",

The analytical theory developed here takes into account the dependence of the scattering opacity on the photon energy. It is shown that the plasma temperature as well as the asymptotic rate of photon escape from the plasma cloud determine the shape of the upscattered hard tail in the emergent spectra, even in the case of very small optical depths. The escape distributions of photons are given for any optical depth of the plasma cloud and their asymptotic dependence for very small and large optical depths are examined.

Although the above authors illustrate the many legitimate uses of these statistics, in some important cases it can be impossible to compute the correct false positive rate. For example, it has become common practice to use the LRT or the F-test to detect a line in a spectral model or a source above background despite the lack of certain required regularity conditions. (These applications were not originally suggested by Cash or by Bevington.) In these and other settings that involve testing a hypothesis that is on the boundary of the parameter space, contrary to common practice, the nominal χ&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; distribution for the LRT or the F-distribution for the F-test should not be used. In this paper, we characterize an important class of problems in which the LRT and the F-test fail and illustrate this nonstandard behavior. We briefly sketch several possible acceptable alternatives, focusing on Bayesian posterior predictive probability values. We present this method in some detail since it is a simple, robust, and intuitive approach. This alternative method is illustrated using the gamma-ray burst of 1997 May 8 (GRB 970508) to investigate the presence of an Fe K emission line during the initial phase of the observation. There are many legitimate uses of the LRT and the F-test in astrophysics, and even when these tests are inappropriate, there remain several statistical alternatives (e.g., judicious use of error bars and Bayes factors). Nevertheless, there are numerous cases of the inappropriate use of the LRT and similar tests in the literature, bringing substantive scientific results into question.</td>\n",

The equations of hydrodynamics and radiative diffusion are solved analytically in a one-dimensional approximation.

The limiting X-ray luminosity of accreting magnetized neutron stars is shown to depend crucially on the geometry of the accretion channel. The effects connected with the gas flow along the magnetospheric surface are discussed in detail. The plasma layer on the Alfven surface is shown to be optically thick with respect to Thomson scattering and to reradiate in soft X-rays a considerable fraction of the primary X-ray flux.

       "      <td>Context. Accretion-powered X-ray pulsars exhibit significant variability of the cyclotron resonance scattering feature (CRSF) centroid energy on pulse-to-pulse timescales, and also on much longer timescales. Two types of spectral variability are observed. For sources in group 1, the CRSF energy is negatively correlated with the variable source luminosity, and for sources in group 2, the opposite behavior is observed. The physical basis for this bimodal behavior is currently not well understood. &lt;BR /&gt; Aims: We explore the hypothesis that the accretion dynamics in the group 1 sources is dominated by radiation pressure near the stellar surface, and that Coulomb interactions decelerate the gas to rest in the group 2 sources. &lt;BR /&gt; Methods: We derive a new expression for the critical luminosity, L&lt;SUB&gt;crit&lt;/SUB&gt;, such that radiation pressure decelerates the matter to rest in sources with X-ray luminosity L&lt;SUB&gt;X&lt;/SUB&gt; &amp;gt; L&lt;SUB&gt;crit&lt;/SUB&gt;. The formula for L&lt;SUB&gt;crit&lt;/SUB&gt; is based on a simple physical model for the structure of the accretion column in luminous X-ray pulsars that takes into account radiative deceleration, the energy dependence of the cyclotron cross section, the thermodynamics of the accreting gas, the dipole structure of the pulsar magnetosphere, and the diffusive escape of radiation through the column walls. We show that for typical neutron star parameters, Lcrit = 1.5 × 10&lt;SUP&gt;37&lt;/SUP&gt; B&lt;SUB&gt;12&lt;SUP&gt;16/15&lt;/SUP&gt; erg s&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt;-1&lt;/SUP&gt;, where B&lt;SUB&gt;12&lt;/SUB&gt; is the surface magnetic field strength in units of 10&lt;SUP&gt;12&lt;/SUP&gt; G. Results: The formula for the critical luminosity is evaluated for five sources, using the maximum value of the CRSF centroid energy to estimate the surface magnetic field strength B&lt;SUB&gt;12&lt;/SUB&gt;. The results confirm that the group 1 sources are supercritical (L&lt;SUB&gt;X&lt;/SUB&gt; &amp;gt; L&lt;SUB&gt;crit&lt;/SUB&gt;) and the group 2 sources are subcritical (L&lt;SUB&gt;X&lt;/SUB&gt; &amp;lt; L&lt;SUB&gt;crit&lt;/SUB&gt;), although the situation is less clear for those highly variable sources that cross over the line L&lt;SUB&gt;X&lt;/SUB&gt; = L&lt;SUB&gt;crit&lt;/SUB&gt;. We also explain the variation of the CRSF energy with luminosity as a consequence of the variation of the characteristic emission height. The sign of this dependence is opposite in the supercritical and subcritical cases, hence creating the observed bimodal behavior. Conclusions: We have developed a new model for the critical luminosity in accretion-powered X-ray pulsars that explains the bimodal dependence of the CRSF centroid energy on the X-ray luminosity L&lt;SUB&gt;X&lt;/SUB&gt;. Our model provides a physical basis for the observed variation of the CRSF energy as a function of L&lt;SUB&gt;X&lt;/SUB&gt; for both the group 1 (supercritical) and the group 2 (subcritical) sources as a result of the variation of the emission height in the column.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Cyclotron resonance scattering features observed in the spectra of some X-ray pulsars show significant changes of the line centroid energy with the pulsar luminosity. Whereas for bright sources above the so-called critical luminosity, these variations are established to be connected with the appearance of the high-accretion column above the neutron star surface, at low, sub-critical luminosities the nature of the variations (but with the opposite sign) has not been discussed widely. We argue here that the cyclotron line is formed when the radiation from a hotspot propagates through the plasma falling with a mildly relativistic velocity on to the neutron star surface. The position of the cyclotron resonance is determined by the Doppler effect. The change of the cyclotron line position in the spectrum with luminosity is caused by variations of the velocity profile in the line-forming region affected by the radiation pressure force. The presented model has several characteristic features: (i) the line centroid energy is positively correlated with the luminosity; (ii) the line width is positively correlated with the luminosity as well; (iii) the position and the width of the cyclotron absorption line are variable over the pulse phase; (iv) the line has a more complicated shape than widely used Lorentzian or Gaussian profiles; (v) the phase-resolved cyclotron line centroid energy and the width are negatively and positively correlated with the pulse intensity, respectively. The predictions of the proposed theory are compared with the variations of the cyclotron line parameters in the X-ray pulsar GX 304-1 over a wide range of sub-critical luminosities as seen by the INTEGRAL observatory.</td>\n",

At high luminosities, these variations are often associated with the onset and growth of the accretion column, which is believed to be the origin of the observed emission and of the cyclotron lines. However, this scenario inevitably implies a large gradient of the magnetic field strength within the line-forming region, which makes the formation of the observed line-like features problematic. Moreover, the observed variation of the cyclotron line energy is much smaller than could be anticipated for the corresponding luminosity changes. We argue here that a more physically realistic situation is that the cyclotron line forms when the radiation emitted by the accretion column is reflected from the neutron star surface, where the gradient of the magnetic field strength is significantly smaller.

It is shown, however, that the particular pitch distribution postulated by Ghosh and Lamb is not consistent, since the resulting magnetic pressure would disrupt their disc beyond the corotation point.

We observed Her X-1 three times, coordinated with Suzaku, during one of the high flux intervals of its 35 day superorbital period. This paper focuses on the shape and evolution of the hard X-ray spectrum. The broadband spectra can be fitted with a power law with a high-energy cutoff, an iron line, and a CRSF. We find that the CRSF has a very smooth and symmetric shape in all observations and at all pulse phases. We compare the residuals of a line with a Gaussian optical-depth profile to a Lorentzian optical-depth profile and find no significant differences, strongly constraining the very smooth shape of the line. Even though the line energy changes dramatically with pulse phase, we find that its smooth shape does not. Additionally, our data show that the continuum only changes marginally between the three observations. These changes can be explained with varying amounts of Thomson scattering in the hot corona of the accretion disk. The average, luminosity-corrected CRSF energy is lower than in past observations and follows a secular decline.

While the fundamental line is not revealed, the second harmonic of the CRSF can be clearly detected in all the spectra, at an energy varying between ∼53 and ∼58 keV, directly correlated with the luminosity. We have further investigated the evolution of the CRSF in time, by studying the intensity-selected spectra built along four 33-month time intervals along the survey.

The spectra in these states are considerably softer than the outburst spectra and appear to soften in time when the luminosity decreases. The physical mechanism behind these meta-stable states is unclear and they could be due to low-level accretion (either directly on to the neutron stars or on to their magnetospheres) or due to cooling of the accretion-heated neutron star crusts. Based on the spectra, the slowly decreasing luminosities, and the spectral softening, we favour the crust cooling hypothesis but we cannot exclude the accretion scenarios.

In Sections 2-3, we detail the methods which the Swift-XRT team has developed to produce the enhanced positions, light curves, hardness ratios and spectra presented in this paper. Software using these methods continues to create such products for all new GRBs observed by the Swift-XRT. We also detail web-based tools allowing users to create these products for any object observed by the XRT, not just GRBs. In Sections 4-6, we present the results of our analysis of GRBs, including probability distribution functions of the temporal and spectral properties of the sample. We demonstrate evidence for a consistent underlying behaviour which can produce a range of light-curve morphologies, and attempt to interpret this behaviour in the framework of external forward shock emission. We find several difficulties, in particular that reconciliation of our data with the forward shock model requires energy injection to continue for days to weeks.   \n",

It is found that the magnetic coupling between the star and the plasma in the outer transition zone is appreciable; that as a result, the spin-up torque on fast rotators is substantially less than that on slow rotators, and that for sufficiently high stellar angular velocities or sufficiently low mass accretion rates, the rotation of the star can be braked while accretion continues. These results are applied to pulsating X-ray sources, revealing that at high luminosities a star of given spin period rotating in the same direction as the disk can experience either spin-up or spin-down, depending on its luminosity. Also considered are the general problem of interpreting period changes in pulsating X-ray sources, and the dipole magnetic moments of nine pulsating X-ray sources are estimated by fitting the theoretical spin-up equation to estimates of the average luminosity and spin-up rate of each source.   \n",

Analytical expressions are obtained for the produced spectrum as a function of such input parameters as the plasma temperature, the optical depth of the plasma cloud and the injected soft photon spectrum. The analytical theory developed here takes into account the dependence of the scattering opacity on the photon energy. It is shown that the plasma temperature as well as the asymptotic rate of photon escape from the plasma cloud determine the shape of the upscattered hard tail in the emergent spectra, even in the case of very small optical depths. The escape distributions of photons are given for any optical depth of the plasma cloud and their asymptotic dependence for very small and large optical depths are examined. It is shown that this new generalized approach can fit spectra for a large variety of hard X-ray sources and determine the plasma temperature in the region of main energy release in Cyg X-1 and the Seyfert galaxy NGC 4151.   \n",

Although the above authors illustrate the many legitimate uses of these statistics, in some important cases it can be impossible to compute the correct false positive rate. For example, it has become common practice to use the LRT or the F-test to detect a line in a spectral model or a source above background despite the lack of certain required regularity conditions. (These applications were not originally suggested by Cash or by Bevington.) In these and other settings that involve testing a hypothesis that is on the boundary of the parameter space, contrary to common practice, the nominal χ<SUP>2</SUP> distribution for the LRT or the F-distribution for the F-test should not be used. In this paper, we characterize an important class of problems in which the LRT and the F-test fail and illustrate this nonstandard behavior. We briefly sketch several possible acceptable alternatives, focusing on Bayesian posterior predictive probability values. We present this method in some detail since it is a simple, robust, and intuitive approach. This alternative method is illustrated using the gamma-ray burst of 1997 May 8 (GRB 970508) to investigate the presence of an Fe K emission line during the initial phase of the observation. There are many legitimate uses of the LRT and the F-test in astrophysics, and even when these tests are inappropriate, there remain several statistical alternatives (e.g., judicious use of error bars and Bayes factors). Nevertheless, there are numerous cases of the inappropriate use of the LRT and similar tests in the literature, bringing substantive scientific results into question.   \n",

The equations of hydrodynamics and radiative diffusion are solved analytically in a one-dimensional approximation. The luminosity is evaluated beyond which one should allow for the dynamic effect of emergent light on the infalling material. The limiting X-ray luminosity of accreting magnetized neutron stars is shown to depend crucially on the geometry of the accretion channel. The effects connected with the gas flow along the magnetospheric surface are discussed in detail. The plasma layer on the Alfven surface is shown to be optically thick with respect to Thomson scattering and to reradiate in soft X-rays a considerable fraction of the primary X-ray flux. A necessary condition for the X-ray luminosity to exceed the Eddington limit is a certain degree of asymmetry in the distribution of matter over the Alfven surface.   \n",
       "6   Context. Accretion-powered X-ray pulsars exhibit significant variability of the cyclotron resonance scattering feature (CRSF) centroid energy on pulse-to-pulse timescales, and also on much longer timescales. Two types of spectral variability are observed. For sources in group 1, the CRSF energy is negatively correlated with the variable source luminosity, and for sources in group 2, the opposite behavior is observed. The physical basis for this bimodal behavior is currently not well understood. <BR /> Aims: We explore the hypothesis that the accretion dynamics in the group 1 sources is dominated by radiation pressure near the stellar surface, and that Coulomb interactions decelerate the gas to rest in the group 2 sources. <BR /> Methods: We derive a new expression for the critical luminosity, L<SUB>crit</SUB>, such that radiation pressure decelerates the matter to rest in sources with X-ray luminosity L<SUB>X</SUB> &gt; L<SUB>crit</SUB>. The formula for L<SUB>crit</SUB> is based on a simple physical model for the structure of the accretion column in luminous X-ray pulsars that takes into account radiative deceleration, the energy dependence of the cyclotron cross section, the thermodynamics of the accreting gas, the dipole structure of the pulsar magnetosphere, and the diffusive escape of radiation through the column walls. We show that for typical neutron star parameters, Lcrit = 1.5 × 10<SUP>37</SUP> B<SUB>12<SUP>16/15</SUP> erg s</SUB><SUP>-1</SUP>, where B<SUB>12</SUB> is the surface magnetic field strength in units of 10<SUP>12</SUP> G. Results: The formula for the critical luminosity is evaluated for five sources, using the maximum value of the CRSF centroid energy to estimate the surface magnetic field strength B<SUB>12</SUB>. The results confirm that the group 1 sources are supercritical (L<SUB>X</SUB> &gt; L<SUB>crit</SUB>) and the group 2 sources are subcritical (L<SUB>X</SUB> &lt; L<SUB>crit</SUB>), although the situation is less clear for those highly variable sources that cross over the line L<SUB>X</SUB> = L<SUB>crit</SUB>. We also explain the variation of the CRSF energy with luminosity as a consequence of the variation of the characteristic emission height. The sign of this dependence is opposite in the supercritical and subcritical cases, hence creating the observed bimodal behavior. Conclusions: We have developed a new model for the critical luminosity in accretion-powered X-ray pulsars that explains the bimodal dependence of the CRSF centroid energy on the X-ray luminosity L<SUB>X</SUB>. Our model provides a physical basis for the observed variation of the CRSF energy as a function of L<SUB>X</SUB> for both the group 1 (supercritical) and the group 2 (subcritical) sources as a result of the variation of the emission height in the column.   \n",

Whereas for bright sources above the so-called critical luminosity, these variations are established to be connected with the appearance of the high-accretion column above the neutron star surface, at low, sub-critical luminosities the nature of the variations (but with the opposite sign) has not been discussed widely. We argue here that the cyclotron line is formed when the radiation from a hotspot propagates through the plasma falling with a mildly relativistic velocity on to the neutron star surface. The position of the cyclotron resonance is determined by the Doppler effect. The change of the cyclotron line position in the spectrum with luminosity is caused by variations of the velocity profile in the line-forming region affected by the radiation pressure force. The presented model has several characteristic features: (i) the line centroid energy is positively correlated with the luminosity; (ii) the line width is positively correlated with the luminosity as well; (iii) the position and the width of the cyclotron absorption line are variable over the pulse phase; (iv) the line has a more complicated shape than widely used Lorentzian or Gaussian profiles; (v) the phase-resolved cyclotron line centroid energy and the width are negatively and positively correlated with the pulse intensity, respectively. The predictions of the proposed theory are compared with the variations of the cyclotron line parameters in the X-ray pulsar GX 304-1 over a wide range of sub-critical luminosities as seen by the INTEGRAL observatory.   \n",

At high luminosities, these variations are often associated with the onset and growth of the accretion column, which is believed to be the origin of the observed emission and of the cyclotron lines. However, this scenario inevitably implies a large gradient of the magnetic field strength within the line-forming region, which makes the formation of the observed line-like features problematic. Moreover, the observed variation of the cyclotron line energy is much smaller than could be anticipated for the corresponding luminosity changes. We argue here that a more physically realistic situation is that the cyclotron line forms when the radiation emitted by the accretion column is reflected from the neutron star surface, where the gradient of the magnetic field strength is significantly smaller. Here we develop a reflection model and apply it to explain the observed variations of the cyclotron line energy in a bright X-ray pulsar V 0332+53 over a wide range of luminosities.   \n",

The current observational campaigns were performed with the Swift/XRT telescope in the soft X-ray band (0.5-10 keV) during the declining phases of the outbursts exhibited by both sources in 2015. <BR /> Results: The transitions to the propeller regime were detected at the threshold luminosities of (1.4 ± 0.4) × 10<SUP>36</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP> and (2.0 ± 0.4) × 10<SUP>36</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP> for 4U 0115+63 and V 0332+53, respectively. Spectra of the sources are shown to be significantly softer during the low state. In both sources, the accretion at rates close to the aforementioned threshold values briefly resumes during the periastron passage following the transition into the propeller regime. The strength of the dipole component of the magnetic field required to inhibit the accretion agrees well with estimates based on the position of the cyclotron lines in their spectra, thus excluding presence of a strong multipole component of the magnetic field in the vicinity of the neutron star.   \n",

As in the widely adopted model of Ghosh and Lamb, the magnetospheric field is assumed to thread the disc both inside and outside the radius of corotation, yielding opposing contributions to the net torque from the forward- and backward-swept field lines. It is shown, however, that the particular pitch distribution postulated by Ghosh and Lamb is not consistent, since the resulting magnetic pressure would disrupt their disc beyond the corotation point. By taking the winding rate proportional to the poloidal rather than the toroidal component of the field, the author obtains a more realistic behaviour for the magnetic stresses generated by the rotational shear. He then discusses the results in the light of period-change measurements for several binary X-ray pulsars.   \n",

We find that the centroid energy of the CRSF in Her X-1 changes by ~5% in energy for a factor of 2 in luminosity. The correlation is positive, contrary to what is observed in some high luminosity transient pulsars. <BR />Conclusions: . Our finding is the first significant measurement of a positive correlation between E<SUB>c</SUB> and luminosity in any X-ray pulsar. We suggest that this behaviour is expected in the case of sub-Eddington accretion and present a calculation of a quantitative estimate, which is very consistent with the effect observed in Her X-1. We urge that Her X-1 is regularly monitored further and that other X-ray pulsars are investigated for a similar behaviour.   \n",

A cyclotron resonance scattering line at an energy of ~26 keV has been detected in the source spectrum together with its two higher harmonics at ~50 and ~73 keV, respectively. We show that the energy of the line is not constant but changes linearly with the source luminosity. Strong pulse profile variations, especially near the cyclotron line, are revealed for different levels of source intensity. We discuss the obtained results in terms of the theoretical models of X-ray pulsars.   \n",

The explosion fuses a large amount of radioactive <SUP>56</SUP>Ni (refs 1-3). After the explosion, the decay chain from <SUP>56</SUP>Ni to <SUP>56</SUP>Co to <SUP>56</SUP>Fe generates γ-ray photons, which are reprocessed in the expanding ejecta and give rise to powerful optical emission. Here we report the detection of <SUP>56</SUP>Co lines at energies of 847 and 1,238 kiloelectronvolts and a γ-ray continuum in the 200-400 kiloelectronvolt band from the type Ia supernova 2014J in the nearby galaxy M82. The line fluxes suggest that about 0.6 +/- 0.1 solar masses of radioactive <SUP>56</SUP>Ni were synthesized during the explosion. The line broadening gives a characteristic mass-weighted ejecta expansion velocity of 10,000 +/- 3,000 kilometres per second. The observed γ-ray properties are in broad agreement with the canonical model of an explosion of a white dwarf just massive enough to be unstable to gravitational collapse, but do not exclude merger scenarios that fuse comparable amounts of <SUP>56</SUP>Ni.   \n",

In the special case of X-ray-emitting binary pulsars, a direct estimate of the field strength can be obtained by measuring the energy of spectral features that are due to electron cyclotron resonance<SUP>4-13</SUP>. With the Ginga satellite observatory<SUP>14,15</SUP>, we have measured a cyclotron feature in the hard X-ray spectrum of the 1.24-s binary pulsar Hercules X-1 with a much greater energy resolution than in previous observations4-9. The spectrum from 10-60 keV can be described with a simple analytical formula<SUP>12,16,17</SUP>, which indicates an absorption feature at ~34 keV rather than an emission feature at ~50keV. From this we estimate the surface magnetic field strength of Her X-1 to be (2.9+/-0.3) × 10<SUP>12</SUP> G.   \n",

We show that while the phase-averaged and spatially integrated nebula + pulsar spectrum is a power law in this energy band, spatially resolved spectroscopy of the nebula finds a break at ~9 keV in the spectral photon index of the torus structure with a steepening characterized by ΔΓ ~ 0.25. We also confirm a previously reported steepening in the pulsed spectrum, and quantify it with a broken power law with break energy at ~12 keV and ΔΓ ~ 0.27. We present spectral maps of the inner 100'' of the remnant and measure the size of the nebula as a function of energy in seven bands. These results find that the rate of shrinkage with energy of the torus size can be fitted by a power law with an index of γ = 0.094 ± 0.018, consistent with the predictions of Kennel and Coroniti. The change in size is more rapid in the NW direction, coinciding with the counter-jet where we find the index to be a factor of two larger. NuSTAR observed the Crab during the latter part of a γ-ray flare, but found no increase in flux in the 3-78 keV energy band.   \n",

We observed Her X-1 three times, coordinated with Suzaku, during one of the high flux intervals of its 35 day superorbital period. This paper focuses on the shape and evolution of the hard X-ray spectrum. The broadband spectra can be fitted with a power law with a high-energy cutoff, an iron line, and a CRSF. We find that the CRSF has a very smooth and symmetric shape in all observations and at all pulse phases. We compare the residuals of a line with a Gaussian optical-depth profile to a Lorentzian optical-depth profile and find no significant differences, strongly constraining the very smooth shape of the line. Even though the line energy changes dramatically with pulse phase, we find that its smooth shape does not. Additionally, our data show that the continuum only changes marginally between the three observations. These changes can be explained with varying amounts of Thomson scattering in the hot corona of the accretion disk. The average, luminosity-corrected CRSF energy is lower than in past observations and follows a secular decline. The excellent data quality of NuSTAR provides the best constraint on the CRSF energy to date.   \n",

The recipe for calculation of the scattering matrix elements, the differential and total cross sections based on quantum electrodynamic second-order perturbation theory is presented for the case of arbitrary initial and final Landau level, electron momentum along the field and photon momentum. Photon polarization and electron spin state are taken into account. The correct dependence of natural Landau level width on the electron spin state is taken into account in a general case of arbitrary initial photon momentum for the first time. A number of steps in the calculations were simplified analytically making the presented recipe easy to use. The redistribution functions over the photon energy, momentum and polarization states are presented and discussed. The paper generalizes already known results and offers a basis for the accurate calculation of radiation transfer in a strong B field, for example, in strongly magnetized neutron stars.   \n",

We report on the high-energy spectrum of the source, concentrating on cyclotron resonant scattering features. The spectrum is strongly pulse phase dependent, and absorption features are detected at virtually all phases. In particular, four absorption-like features at 12.74, 24.16, 35.74, and 49.5 keV are observed in the descending edge of the main peak of the pulse profile. The ratios between the centroid energies of the lines with respect to the first are 1:(1.9):(2.8):(3.9). These values are close to the harmonic relation expected from cyclotron resonant scattering in a strong magnetic field when relativistic effects are taken into account. The equivalent widths of the second, third, and fourth harmonics are found to be larger than that of the first harmonic, confirming the key role of two-photon processes in the spectral formation. These results provide the first evidence for four harmonically spaced lines in the spectrum of an accreting X-ray pulsar, yielding the clearest confirmation to date of their magnetic origin.   \n",

Observational data covering the outburst brightening phase are analysed in detail for the first time. A comparison of source parameters and their evolution during the brightening and fading phases shows no evidence for any hysteretic behaviour. It is found that the dependences of the energy of the cyclotron absorption line on the luminosity during the brightening and fading phases are almost identical. The complete data sequence including the outburst brightening and fading phases makes it possible to impose the more stringent constraints on the magnetic field in the source. The pulse profile and pulsed fraction are studied as functions of the luminosity and photon energy.   \n",

X-ray spectra of many accreting pulsars exhibit significant variations as a function of flux and thus of mass accretion rate. In some of these pulsars, the centroid energy of the cyclotron line(s), which characterizes the magnetic field strength at the site of the X-ray emission, has been found to vary systematically with flux. <BR /> Aims: GX 304-1 is a recently established cyclotron line source with a line energy around 50 keV. Since 2009, the pulsar shows regular outbursts with the peak flux exceeding one Crab. We analyze the INTEGRAL observations of the source during its outburst in January - February 2012. <BR /> Methods: The observations covered almost the entire outburst, allowing us to measure the source's broad-band X-ray spectrum at different flux levels. We report on the variations in the spectral parameters with luminosity and focus on the variations in the cyclotron line. <BR /> Results: The centroid energy of the line is found to be positively correlated with the luminosity. We interpret this result as a manifestation of the local sub-Eddington (sub-critical) accretion regime operating in the source.   \n",

We report on the detection of three cyclotron resonance features at 27, 51, and 74 keV in the phase-averaged data, corresponding to a polar magnetic field of 2.7×10<SUP>12</SUP> G. After 4U 0115+63, this makes V0332+53 the second accreting neutron star in which more than two cyclotron lines have been detected; this has now also been confirmed by INTEGRAL. Pulse-phase spectroscopy reveals remarkably little variability of the cyclotron line through the 4.4 s X-ray pulse.   \n",

We characterize the spectra quantitatively and built the detailed `three-dimensional' picture of spectral variations with pulse phase and throughout the outburst. We show that all spectral parameters are strongly variable with the pulse phase, and the pattern of this variability significantly changes with luminosity directly reflecting the associated changes in the structure of emission regions and their beam patterns. Obtained results are qualitatively discussed in terms of the recently developed reflection model for the formation of cyclotron lines in the spectra of X-ray pulsars.   \n",

We decompose the X-ray and soft gamma-ray emission of the central part of the Milky Way into relatively compact 'bulge' and more extended 'disc' components and report their spectral properties. The bulge component shows a prominent 511-keV line and essentially no flux at 1.8 MeV, while the disc component on the contrary contains a prominent 1.8-MeV line and a very weak annihilation line. <P />We show that the spectral shape of the annihilation radiation (the narrow 511-keV line and the associated ortho-positronium continuum) is surprisingly well described by a model of annihilation of hot positrons in a radiatively cooling interstellar medium (ISM). The model assumes that positrons are initially injected into a hot (∼10<SUP>6</SUP> K), volume-filling ISM, which is allowed to freely cool via radiative losses. The annihilation time in such a medium is longer than the cooling time for temperatures higher than a few 10<SUP>4</SUP> K. Thus, most of the positrons annihilate only after the gas has cooled down to ∼10<SUP>5</SUP> K, giving rise to annihilation emission characteristic of a warm, ionized ISM.   \n",

We model the material flow in the surface layers of the star by an assumed two-dimensional velocity field satisfying all the physical requirements. Using this model velocity we find that, in the absence of magnetic buoyancy, the surface field is screened (i.e. there is submergence of the field by advection) within the time-scale of material flow of the top layers. On the other hand, if magnetic buoyancy is present, the screening happens over a time-scale that is characteristic of the slower flow of the deeper (and hence, denser) layers. For accreting neutron stars, this longer time-scale turns out to be about 10<SUP>5</SUP>yr, which is of a similar order of magnitude to the accretion time-scale of most massive X-ray binaries.   \n",

High-statistics, intensity-selected spectra were built along 11 years of BAT survey. While the fundamental line is not revealed, the second harmonic of the CRSF can be clearly detected in all the spectra, at an energy varying between ∼53 and ∼58 keV, directly correlated with the luminosity. We have further investigated the evolution of the CRSF in time, by studying the intensity-selected spectra built along four 33-month time intervals along the survey. For the first time, we find in this source a secular variation in the CRSF energy: independent of the source luminosity, the CRSF second harmonic energy decreases by ∼0.36 keV yr<SUP>-1</SUP> between the first and the third time intervals, corresponding to an apparent decay of the magnetic field of ∼3 × 10<SUP>10</SUP> G yr<SUP>-1</SUP>. The intensity-cyclotron energy pattern is consistent between the third and the last time intervals. A possible interpretation for this decay could be the settling of an accreted mound that produces either a distortion of the poloidal magnetic field on the polar cap or a geometrical displacement of the line forming region. This hypothesis seems supported by the correspondence between the rate of the line shift per unit accreted mass and the mass accreted on the polar cap per unit area in Vela X-1 and Her X-1, respectively.   \n",

We report evidence for a clear drop in the observed magnetic field in the accreting pulsar V0332+53 after undergoing a bright 3-month long X-ray outburst. We determine the field from the position of the fundamental cyclotron line in its X-ray spectrum and relate it to the luminosity. For equal levels of luminosity, in the declining phase we measure a systematically lower value of the cyclotron line energy with respect to the rising phase. This results in a drop of ∼1.7 × 10<SUP>11</SUP> G of the observed field between the onset and the end of the outburst. The settling of the accreted plasma on to the polar cap seems to induce a distortion of the magnetic field lines weakening their intensity along the accretion columns. Therefore, the dissipation rate of the magnetic field could be much faster than previously estimated, unless the field is able to restore its original configuration on a time-scale comparable with the outbursts recurrence time.   \n",

Here we present Swift/XRT follow-up observations at the end of those outbursts. Surprisingly, the sources did not decay back to their known quiescent levels but stalled at a (slowly decaying) meta-stable state with luminosities a factor ∼10 above that observed in quiescence. The spectra in these states are considerably softer than the outburst spectra and appear to soften in time when the luminosity decreases. The physical mechanism behind these meta-stable states is unclear and they could be due to low-level accretion (either directly on to the neutron stars or on to their magnetospheres) or due to cooling of the accretion-heated neutron star crusts. Based on the spectra, the slowly decreasing luminosities, and the spectral softening, we favour the crust cooling hypothesis but we cannot exclude the accretion scenarios. On top of this meta-stable state, weak accretion events were observed that occurred at periastron passage and may thus be related to regular type-I outbursts.   \n",

These were acquired during the outburst in June-October 2015. We modeled the observed changes in the spin-frequency of the pulsar and deduced the orbital parameters of the system. We significantly improved existing constrains and show that contrary to previous findings, no change in orbital parameters is required to explain the spin evolution of the source during the outbursts in 1983, 2005, and 2015. The reconstructed intrinsic spin-up of the neutron star during the latest outburst is found to be comparable with previously observed values and predictions of the accretion torque theory.   \n",

All of the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer data acquired in the 2004-2005 outburst were utilized. The 3-80 keV source luminosity varied between 1.7 × 10<SUP>36</SUP> and 3.5 × 10<SUP>38</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>, assuming a distance of 7 kpc. We confirmed that the fundamental cyclotron resonance energy changed from ~22 to ~27 keV, in a clear anti-correlation with the source luminosity and without any hysteresis effects between the rising and declining phases of the outburst. In contrast, the second harmonic energy changed from ~49 to ~54 keV, implying a weaker fractional change as a function of the luminosity. As a result, the observed resonance energy ratio between the second harmonic and the fundamental was ~2.2 when the source was most luminous, whereas the ratio decreased to the nominal value of 2.0 at the least luminous state. Although the significance of this effect is model dependent, these results suggest that the fundamental and second harmonic resonances represent different heights in the accretion column, depending on the mass accretion rate.   \n",

This was found for the pulse phase-averaged line centroid energy using observational data from various X-ray satellites over the time period 1996 to 2012, establishing a reduction of ~4 keV. Here we report on the result of a new observation by NuSTAR performed in August 2015. The earlier results are confirmed and strengthened with respect to both the dependence of E<SUB>cyc</SUB> on flux (it is still present after 2006) and the dependence on time: the long-term decay continued with the same rate, corresponding to a reduction of ~5 keV in 20 yr.   \n",

This instability develops at the onset of accretion, in the thin boundary layer between the accretion disk and neutron star magnetosphere. As a result, the matter collected in the boundary layer can rapidly fall onto the NS surface close to the magnetic poles, but not exactly along the field lines by which the stationary accretion proceeds. This explains the shift in cyclotron line energy measured using RXTE data in a pre-outburst spike, with respect to the line energy observed during the main outburst. Furthermore, the instability can account for the difference in pulse profiles, and their energy evolution that is different in the pre-outburst flare and main outburst.   \n",

Episodic flaring activity is a common feature of X-ray pulsars in HMXBs. In some Be/X-ray binaries flares were observed in quiescence or prior to outbursts. EXO 2030+375 is a Be/X-ray binary showing \"normal\" outbursts almost every ~46 days, near periastron passage of the orbital revolution. Some of these outbursts were occasionally monitored with the INTEGRAL observatory. <BR /> Aims: The INTEGRAL data revealed strong quasi-periodic flaring activity during the rising part of one of the system's outburst. Such activity has previously been observed in EXO 2030+375 only once, in 1985 with EXOSAT. (Some indications of single flares have also been observed with other satellites.) <BR /> Methods: We present the analysis of the flaring behavior of the source based on INTEGRAL data and compare it with the flares observed in EXO 2030+375 in 1985. <BR /> Results: Based on the observational properties of the flares, we argue that the instability at the inner edge of the accretion disk is the most probable cause of the flaring activity.   \n",

The structure and the stability of the magnetosphere, the interaction between the magnetosphere and accreted matter, as well as evolution of neutron star in close binary system are examined within the framework of the two-stream model of nonradial accretion onto a magnetized neutron star. Observable parameters of X-ray pulsars are explained in terms of the model considered.   \n",

The magnetic field is a crucial ingredient of neutron stars. It governs the physics of accretion and of the resulting high-energy emission in accreting pulsars. Studies of the cyclotron resonant scattering features (CRSFs) seen as absorption lines in the X-ray spectra of the pulsars permit direct measurements of the field strength. <BR /> Aims: From an analysis of a number of pointed observations with different instruments, the energy of CRSF, E<SUB>cyc</SUB>, has recently been found to decay in <ASTROBJ>Her X-1</ASTROBJ> , which is one of the best-studied accreting pulsars. We present our analysis of a homogeneous and almost uninterrupted monitoring of the line energy with Swift/BAT. <BR /> Methods: We analyzed the archival Swift/BAT observations of <ASTROBJ>Her X-1</ASTROBJ> from 2005 to 2014. The data were used to measure the CRSF energy averaged over several months. <BR /> Results: The analysis confirms the long-term decay of the line energy. The downward trend is highly significant and consistent with the trend measured with the pointed observations: dE<SUB>cyc</SUB>/ dt ~ -0.3 keV per year. <BR /> Conclusions: The decay of E<SUB>cyc</SUB> either indicates a local evolution of the magnetic field structure in the polar regions of the neutron star or a geometrical displacement of the line-forming region due to long-term changes in the structure of the X-ray emitting region. The shortness of the observed timescale of the decay, -E<SUB>cyc</SUB>/Ė<SUB>cyc</SUB> ~ 100 yr, suggests that trend reversals and/or jumps of the line energy might be observed in the future.   \n",

In July 2015, the high-mass X-ray binary V0332+53 underwent a giant outburst, a decade after the previous one. V0332+53 hosts a strongly magnetized neutron star. During the 2004-2005 outburst, an anti-correlation between the centroid energy of its fundamental cyclotron resonance scattering features (CRSFs) and the X-ray luminosity was observed. <BR /> Aims: The long (≈100 d) and bright (L<SUB>x</SUB> ≈ 10<SUP>38</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>) 2015 outburst provided the opportunity to study the unique properties of the fundamental CRSF during another outburst and to study its dependence on the X-ray luminosity. <BR /> Methods: The source was observed by the INTEGRAL satellite for ~330 ks. We exploit the spectral resolution at high energies of the SPectrometer on INTEGRAL (SPI) and the Joint European X-ray Monitors to characterize its spectral properties, focusing in particular on the CRSF-luminosity dependence. We complement the data of the 2015 outburst with those collected by SPI in 2004-2005, which have so far been left unpublished. <BR /> Results: We find a highly significant anti-correlation of the centroid energy of the fundamental CRSF and the 3-100 keV luminosity of E<SUB>1</SUB> ∝ -0.095(8)L<SUB>37</SUB> keV. This trend is observed for both outbursts. We confirm the correlation between the width of the fundamental CRSF and the X-ray luminosity previously found in the JEM-X and IBIS dataset of the 2004-2005 outburst. By exploiting the RXTE/ASM and Swift/BAT monitoring data, we also report on the detection of a ~34 d modulation superimposed on the mean profiles and roughly consistent with the orbital period of the pulsar. We discuss possible interpretations of such variability.   \n",

The explosion fuses a large amount of radioactive <SUP>56</SUP>Ni (refs 1-3). After the explosion, the decay chain from <SUP>56</SUP>Ni to <SUP>56</SUP>Co to <SUP>56</SUP>Fe generates γ-ray photons, which are reprocessed in the expanding ejecta and give rise to powerful optical emission. Here we report the detection of <SUP>56</SUP>Co lines at energies of 847 and 1,238 kiloelectronvolts and a γ-ray continuum in the 200-400 kiloelectronvolt band from the type Ia supernova 2014J in the nearby galaxy M82. The line fluxes suggest that about 0.6 +/- 0.1 solar masses of radioactive <SUP>56</SUP>Ni were synthesized during the explosion. The line broadening gives a characteristic mass-weighted ejecta expansion velocity of 10,000 +/- 3,000 kilometres per second. The observed γ-ray properties are in broad agreement with the canonical model of an explosion of a white dwarf just massive enough to be unstable to gravitational collapse, but do not exclude merger scenarios that fuse comparable amounts of <SUP>56</SUP>Ni.\n",

These results are applied to pulsating X-ray sources, revealing that at high luminosities a star of given spin period rotating in the same direction as the disk can experience either spin-up or spin-down, depending on its luminosity. Also considered are the general problem of interpreting period changes in pulsating X-ray sources, and the dipole magnetic moments of nine pulsating X-ray sources are estimated by fitting the theoretical spin-up equation to estimates of the average luminosity and spin-up rate of each source.</td>\n",

The analytical theory developed here takes into account the dependence of the scattering opacity on the photon energy. It is shown that the plasma temperature as well as the asymptotic rate of photon escape from the plasma cloud determine the shape of the upscattered hard tail in the emergent spectra, even in the case of very small optical depths. The escape distributions of photons are given for any optical depth of the plasma cloud and their asymptotic dependence for very small and large optical depths are examined.

Although the above authors illustrate the many legitimate uses of these statistics, in some important cases it can be impossible to compute the correct false positive rate. For example, it has become common practice to use the LRT or the F-test to detect a line in a spectral model or a source above background despite the lack of certain required regularity conditions. (These applications were not originally suggested by Cash or by Bevington.) In these and other settings that involve testing a hypothesis that is on the boundary of the parameter space, contrary to common practice, the nominal χ&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; distribution for the LRT or the F-distribution for the F-test should not be used. In this paper, we characterize an important class of problems in which the LRT and the F-test fail and illustrate this nonstandard behavior. We briefly sketch several possible acceptable alternatives, focusing on Bayesian posterior predictive probability values. We present this method in some detail since it is a simple, robust, and intuitive approach. This alternative method is illustrated using the gamma-ray burst of 1997 May 8 (GRB 970508) to investigate the presence of an Fe K emission line during the initial phase of the observation. There are many legitimate uses of the LRT and the F-test in astrophysics, and even when these tests are inappropriate, there remain several statistical alternatives (e.g., judicious use of error bars and Bayes factors).

       "      <td>Context. Accretion-powered X-ray pulsars exhibit significant variability of the cyclotron resonance scattering feature (CRSF) centroid energy on pulse-to-pulse timescales, and also on much longer timescales. Two types of spectral variability are observed. For sources in group 1, the CRSF energy is negatively correlated with the variable source luminosity, and for sources in group 2, the opposite behavior is observed. The physical basis for this bimodal behavior is currently not well understood. &lt;BR /&gt; Aims: We explore the hypothesis that the accretion dynamics in the group 1 sources is dominated by radiation pressure near the stellar surface, and that Coulomb interactions decelerate the gas to rest in the group 2 sources. &lt;BR /&gt; Methods: We derive a new expression for the critical luminosity, L&lt;SUB&gt;crit&lt;/SUB&gt;, such that radiation pressure decelerates the matter to rest in sources with X-ray luminosity L&lt;SUB&gt;X&lt;/SUB&gt; &amp;gt; L&lt;SUB&gt;crit&lt;/SUB&gt;. The formula for L&lt;SUB&gt;crit&lt;/SUB&gt; is based on a simple physical model for the structure of the accretion column in luminous X-ray pulsars that takes into account radiative deceleration, the energy dependence of the cyclotron cross section, the thermodynamics of the accreting gas, the dipole structure of the pulsar magnetosphere, and the diffusive escape of radiation through the column walls. We show that for typical neutron star parameters, Lcrit = 1.5 × 10&lt;SUP&gt;37&lt;/SUP&gt; B&lt;SUB&gt;12&lt;SUP&gt;16/15&lt;/SUP&gt; erg s&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt;-1&lt;/SUP&gt;, where B&lt;SUB&gt;12&lt;/SUB&gt; is the surface magnetic field strength in units of 10&lt;SUP&gt;12&lt;/SUP&gt; G. Results: The formula for the critical luminosity is evaluated for five sources, using the maximum value of the CRSF centroid energy to estimate the surface magnetic field strength B&lt;SUB&gt;12&lt;/SUB&gt;. The results confirm that the group 1 sources are supercritical (L&lt;SUB&gt;X&lt;/SUB&gt; &amp;gt; L&lt;SUB&gt;crit&lt;/SUB&gt;) and the group 2 sources are subcritical (L&lt;SUB&gt;X&lt;/SUB&gt; &amp;lt; L&lt;SUB&gt;crit&lt;/SUB&gt;), although the situation is less clear for those highly variable sources that cross over the line L&lt;SUB&gt;X&lt;/SUB&gt; = L&lt;SUB&gt;crit&lt;/SUB&gt;. We also explain the variation of the CRSF energy with luminosity as a consequence of the variation of the characteristic emission height. The sign of this dependence is opposite in the supercritical and subcritical cases, hence creating the observed bimodal behavior. Conclusions: We have developed a new model for the critical luminosity in accretion-powered X-ray pulsars that explains the bimodal dependence of the CRSF centroid energy on the X-ray luminosity L&lt;SUB&gt;X&lt;/SUB&gt;. Our model provides a physical basis for the observed variation of the CRSF energy as a function of L&lt;SUB&gt;X&lt;/SUB&gt; for both the group 1 (supercritical) and the group 2 (subcritical) sources as a result of the variation of the emission height in the column.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Cyclotron resonance scattering features observed in the spectra of some X-ray pulsars show significant changes of the line centroid energy with the pulsar luminosity. Whereas for bright sources above the so-called critical luminosity, these variations are established to be connected with the appearance of the high-accretion column above the neutron star surface, at low, sub-critical luminosities the nature of the variations (but with the opposite sign) has not been discussed widely. We argue here that the cyclotron line is formed when the radiation from a hotspot propagates through the plasma falling with a mildly relativistic velocity on to the neutron star surface. The position of the cyclotron resonance is determined by the Doppler effect. The change of the cyclotron line position in the spectrum with luminosity is caused by variations of the velocity profile in the line-forming region affected by the radiation pressure force. The presented model has several characteristic features: (i) the line centroid energy is positively correlated with the luminosity; (ii) the line width is positively correlated with the luminosity as well; (iii) the position and the width of the cyclotron absorption line are variable over the pulse phase; (iv) the line has a more complicated shape than widely used Lorentzian or Gaussian profiles; (v) the phase-resolved cyclotron line centroid energy and the width are negatively and positively correlated with the pulse intensity, respectively. The predictions of the proposed theory are compared with the variations of the cyclotron line parameters in the X-ray pulsar GX 304-1 over a wide range of sub-critical luminosities as seen by the INTEGRAL observatory.</td>\n",

At high luminosities, these variations are often associated with the onset and growth of the accretion column, which is believed to be the origin of the observed emission and of the cyclotron lines. However, this scenario inevitably implies a large gradient of the magnetic field strength within the line-forming region, which makes the formation of the observed line-like features problematic. Moreover, the observed variation of the cyclotron line energy is much smaller than could be anticipated for the corresponding luminosity changes. We argue here that a more physically realistic situation is that the cyclotron line forms when the radiation emitted by the accretion column is reflected from the neutron star surface, where the gradient of the magnetic field strength is significantly smaller.

This makes it an ideal target for a detailed study with the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR), taking advantage of its excellent hard X-ray spectral resolution. We observed Her X-1 three times, coordinated with Suzaku, during one of the high flux intervals of its 35 day superorbital period. This paper focuses on the shape and evolution of the hard X-ray spectrum. The broadband spectra can be fitted with a power law with a high-energy cutoff, an iron line, and a CRSF. We find that the CRSF has a very smooth and symmetric shape in all observations and at all pulse phases. We compare the residuals of a line with a Gaussian optical-depth profile to a Lorentzian optical-depth profile and find no significant differences, strongly constraining the very smooth shape of the line. Even though the line energy changes dramatically with pulse phase, we find that its smooth shape does not. Additionally, our data show that the continuum only changes marginally between the three observations. These changes can be explained with varying amounts of Thomson scattering in the hot corona of the accretion disk. The average, luminosity-corrected CRSF energy is lower than in past observations and follows a secular decline. The excellent data quality of NuSTAR provides the best constraint on the CRSF energy to date.</td>\n",

While the fundamental line is not revealed, the second harmonic of the CRSF can be clearly detected in all the spectra, at an energy varying between ∼53 and ∼58 keV, directly correlated with the luminosity. We have further investigated the evolution of the CRSF in time, by studying the intensity-selected spectra built along four 33-month time intervals along the survey.

The spectra in these states are considerably softer than the outburst spectra and appear to soften in time when the luminosity decreases. The physical mechanism behind these meta-stable states is unclear and they could be due to low-level accretion (either directly on to the neutron stars or on to their magnetospheres) or due to cooling of the accretion-heated neutron star crusts. Based on the spectra, the slowly decreasing luminosities, and the spectral softening, we favour the crust cooling hypothesis but we cannot exclude the accretion scenarios.

       "      <td>Context. In July 2015, the high-mass X-ray binary V0332+53 underwent a giant outburst, a decade after the previous one. V0332+53 hosts a strongly magnetized neutron star. During the 2004-2005 outburst, an anti-correlation between the centroid energy of its fundamental cyclotron resonance scattering features (CRSFs) and the X-ray luminosity was observed. &lt;BR /&gt; Aims: The long (≈100 d) and bright (L&lt;SUB&gt;x&lt;/SUB&gt; ≈ 10&lt;SUP&gt;38&lt;/SUP&gt; erg s&lt;SUP&gt;-1&lt;/SUP&gt;) 2015 outburst provided the opportunity to study the unique properties of the fundamental CRSF during another outburst and to study its dependence on the X-ray luminosity. &lt;BR /&gt; Methods: The source was observed by the INTEGRAL satellite for ~330 ks. We exploit the spectral resolution at high energies of the SPectrometer on INTEGRAL (SPI) and the Joint European X-ray Monitors to characterize its spectral properties, focusing in particular on the CRSF-luminosity dependence. We complement the data of the 2015 outburst with those collected by SPI in 2004-2005, which have so far been left unpublished. &lt;BR /&gt; Results: We find a highly significant anti-correlation of the centroid energy of the fundamental CRSF and the 3-100 keV luminosity of E&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt; ∝ -0.095(8)L&lt;SUB&gt;37&lt;/SUB&gt; keV. This trend is observed for both outbursts. We confirm the correlation between the width of the fundamental CRSF and the X-ray luminosity previously found in the JEM-X and IBIS dataset of the 2004-2005 outburst. By exploiting the RXTE/ASM and Swift/BAT monitoring data, we also report on the detection of a ~34 d modulation superimposed on the mean profiles and roughly consistent with the orbital period of the pulsar. We discuss possible interpretations of such variability.</td>\n",
       "      <td>The reference is cited because it reports on the anti-correlation between the centroid energy of the fundamental CRSF and the X-ray luminosity observed during the 2004-2005 outburst of V0332+53. This is relevant to the context because the authors aim to study the dependence of the fundamental CRSF on the X-ray luminosity during the 2015 outburst and compare it to the previous outburst.</td>\n",

In Sections 2-3, we detail the methods which the Swift-XRT team has developed to produce the enhanced positions, light curves, hardness ratios and spectra presented in this paper. Software using these methods continues to create such products for all new GRBs observed by the Swift-XRT. We also detail web-based tools allowing users to create these products for any object observed by the XRT, not just GRBs. In Sections 4-6, we present the results of our analysis of GRBs, including probability distribution functions of the temporal and spectral properties of the sample. We demonstrate evidence for a consistent underlying behaviour which can produce a range of light-curve morphologies, and attempt to interpret this behaviour in the framework of external forward shock emission. We find several difficulties, in particular that reconciliation of our data with the forward shock model requires energy injection to continue for days to weeks.   \n",

It is found that the magnetic coupling between the star and the plasma in the outer transition zone is appreciable; that as a result, the spin-up torque on fast rotators is substantially less than that on slow rotators, and that for sufficiently high stellar angular velocities or sufficiently low mass accretion rates, the rotation of the star can be braked while accretion continues. These results are applied to pulsating X-ray sources, revealing that at high luminosities a star of given spin period rotating in the same direction as the disk can experience either spin-up or spin-down, depending on its luminosity. Also considered are the general problem of interpreting period changes in pulsating X-ray sources, and the dipole magnetic moments of nine pulsating X-ray sources are estimated by fitting the theoretical spin-up equation to estimates of the average luminosity and spin-up rate of each source.   \n",

Analytical expressions are obtained for the produced spectrum as a function of such input parameters as the plasma temperature, the optical depth of the plasma cloud and the injected soft photon spectrum. The analytical theory developed here takes into account the dependence of the scattering opacity on the photon energy. It is shown that the plasma temperature as well as the asymptotic rate of photon escape from the plasma cloud determine the shape of the upscattered hard tail in the emergent spectra, even in the case of very small optical depths. The escape distributions of photons are given for any optical depth of the plasma cloud and their asymptotic dependence for very small and large optical depths are examined. It is shown that this new generalized approach can fit spectra for a large variety of hard X-ray sources and determine the plasma temperature in the region of main energy release in Cyg X-1 and the Seyfert galaxy NGC 4151.   \n",

Although the above authors illustrate the many legitimate uses of these statistics, in some important cases it can be impossible to compute the correct false positive rate. For example, it has become common practice to use the LRT or the F-test to detect a line in a spectral model or a source above background despite the lack of certain required regularity conditions. (These applications were not originally suggested by Cash or by Bevington.) In these and other settings that involve testing a hypothesis that is on the boundary of the parameter space, contrary to common practice, the nominal χ<SUP>2</SUP> distribution for the LRT or the F-distribution for the F-test should not be used. In this paper, we characterize an important class of problems in which the LRT and the F-test fail and illustrate this nonstandard behavior. We briefly sketch several possible acceptable alternatives, focusing on Bayesian posterior predictive probability values. We present this method in some detail since it is a simple, robust, and intuitive approach. This alternative method is illustrated using the gamma-ray burst of 1997 May 8 (GRB 970508) to investigate the presence of an Fe K emission line during the initial phase of the observation. There are many legitimate uses of the LRT and the F-test in astrophysics, and even when these tests are inappropriate, there remain several statistical alternatives (e.g., judicious use of error bars and Bayes factors). Nevertheless, there are numerous cases of the inappropriate use of the LRT and similar tests in the literature, bringing substantive scientific results into question.   \n",

The equations of hydrodynamics and radiative diffusion are solved analytically in a one-dimensional approximation. The luminosity is evaluated beyond which one should allow for the dynamic effect of emergent light on the infalling material. The limiting X-ray luminosity of accreting magnetized neutron stars is shown to depend crucially on the geometry of the accretion channel. The effects connected with the gas flow along the magnetospheric surface are discussed in detail. The plasma layer on the Alfven surface is shown to be optically thick with respect to Thomson scattering and to reradiate in soft X-rays a considerable fraction of the primary X-ray flux. A necessary condition for the X-ray luminosity to exceed the Eddington limit is a certain degree of asymmetry in the distribution of matter over the Alfven surface.   \n",
       "6   Context. Accretion-powered X-ray pulsars exhibit significant variability of the cyclotron resonance scattering feature (CRSF) centroid energy on pulse-to-pulse timescales, and also on much longer timescales. Two types of spectral variability are observed. For sources in group 1, the CRSF energy is negatively correlated with the variable source luminosity, and for sources in group 2, the opposite behavior is observed. The physical basis for this bimodal behavior is currently not well understood. <BR /> Aims: We explore the hypothesis that the accretion dynamics in the group 1 sources is dominated by radiation pressure near the stellar surface, and that Coulomb interactions decelerate the gas to rest in the group 2 sources. <BR /> Methods: We derive a new expression for the critical luminosity, L<SUB>crit</SUB>, such that radiation pressure decelerates the matter to rest in sources with X-ray luminosity L<SUB>X</SUB> &gt; L<SUB>crit</SUB>. The formula for L<SUB>crit</SUB> is based on a simple physical model for the structure of the accretion column in luminous X-ray pulsars that takes into account radiative deceleration, the energy dependence of the cyclotron cross section, the thermodynamics of the accreting gas, the dipole structure of the pulsar magnetosphere, and the diffusive escape of radiation through the column walls. We show that for typical neutron star parameters, Lcrit = 1.5 × 10<SUP>37</SUP> B<SUB>12<SUP>16/15</SUP> erg s</SUB><SUP>-1</SUP>, where B<SUB>12</SUB> is the surface magnetic field strength in units of 10<SUP>12</SUP> G. Results: The formula for the critical luminosity is evaluated for five sources, using the maximum value of the CRSF centroid energy to estimate the surface magnetic field strength B<SUB>12</SUB>. The results confirm that the group 1 sources are supercritical (L<SUB>X</SUB> &gt; L<SUB>crit</SUB>) and the group 2 sources are subcritical (L<SUB>X</SUB> &lt; L<SUB>crit</SUB>), although the situation is less clear for those highly variable sources that cross over the line L<SUB>X</SUB> = L<SUB>crit</SUB>. We also explain the variation of the CRSF energy with luminosity as a consequence of the variation of the characteristic emission height. The sign of this dependence is opposite in the supercritical and subcritical cases, hence creating the observed bimodal behavior. Conclusions: We have developed a new model for the critical luminosity in accretion-powered X-ray pulsars that explains the bimodal dependence of the CRSF centroid energy on the X-ray luminosity L<SUB>X</SUB>. Our model provides a physical basis for the observed variation of the CRSF energy as a function of L<SUB>X</SUB> for both the group 1 (supercritical) and the group 2 (subcritical) sources as a result of the variation of the emission height in the column.   \n",

Whereas for bright sources above the so-called critical luminosity, these variations are established to be connected with the appearance of the high-accretion column above the neutron star surface, at low, sub-critical luminosities the nature of the variations (but with the opposite sign) has not been discussed widely. We argue here that the cyclotron line is formed when the radiation from a hotspot propagates through the plasma falling with a mildly relativistic velocity on to the neutron star surface. The position of the cyclotron resonance is determined by the Doppler effect. The change of the cyclotron line position in the spectrum with luminosity is caused by variations of the velocity profile in the line-forming region affected by the radiation pressure force. The presented model has several characteristic features: (i) the line centroid energy is positively correlated with the luminosity; (ii) the line width is positively correlated with the luminosity as well; (iii) the position and the width of the cyclotron absorption line are variable over the pulse phase; (iv) the line has a more complicated shape than widely used Lorentzian or Gaussian profiles; (v) the phase-resolved cyclotron line centroid energy and the width are negatively and positively correlated with the pulse intensity, respectively. The predictions of the proposed theory are compared with the variations of the cyclotron line parameters in the X-ray pulsar GX 304-1 over a wide range of sub-critical luminosities as seen by the INTEGRAL observatory.   \n",

At high luminosities, these variations are often associated with the onset and growth of the accretion column, which is believed to be the origin of the observed emission and of the cyclotron lines. However, this scenario inevitably implies a large gradient of the magnetic field strength within the line-forming region, which makes the formation of the observed line-like features problematic. Moreover, the observed variation of the cyclotron line energy is much smaller than could be anticipated for the corresponding luminosity changes. We argue here that a more physically realistic situation is that the cyclotron line forms when the radiation emitted by the accretion column is reflected from the neutron star surface, where the gradient of the magnetic field strength is significantly smaller. Here we develop a reflection model and apply it to explain the observed variations of the cyclotron line energy in a bright X-ray pulsar V 0332+53 over a wide range of luminosities.   \n",

The current observational campaigns were performed with the Swift/XRT telescope in the soft X-ray band (0.5-10 keV) during the declining phases of the outbursts exhibited by both sources in 2015. <BR /> Results: The transitions to the propeller regime were detected at the threshold luminosities of (1.4 ± 0.4) × 10<SUP>36</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP> and (2.0 ± 0.4) × 10<SUP>36</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP> for 4U 0115+63 and V 0332+53, respectively. Spectra of the sources are shown to be significantly softer during the low state. In both sources, the accretion at rates close to the aforementioned threshold values briefly resumes during the periastron passage following the transition into the propeller regime. The strength of the dipole component of the magnetic field required to inhibit the accretion agrees well with estimates based on the position of the cyclotron lines in their spectra, thus excluding presence of a strong multipole component of the magnetic field in the vicinity of the neutron star.   \n",

As in the widely adopted model of Ghosh and Lamb, the magnetospheric field is assumed to thread the disc both inside and outside the radius of corotation, yielding opposing contributions to the net torque from the forward- and backward-swept field lines. It is shown, however, that the particular pitch distribution postulated by Ghosh and Lamb is not consistent, since the resulting magnetic pressure would disrupt their disc beyond the corotation point. By taking the winding rate proportional to the poloidal rather than the toroidal component of the field, the author obtains a more realistic behaviour for the magnetic stresses generated by the rotational shear. He then discusses the results in the light of period-change measurements for several binary X-ray pulsars.   \n",

We find that the centroid energy of the CRSF in Her X-1 changes by ~5% in energy for a factor of 2 in luminosity. The correlation is positive, contrary to what is observed in some high luminosity transient pulsars. <BR />Conclusions: . Our finding is the first significant measurement of a positive correlation between E<SUB>c</SUB> and luminosity in any X-ray pulsar. We suggest that this behaviour is expected in the case of sub-Eddington accretion and present a calculation of a quantitative estimate, which is very consistent with the effect observed in Her X-1. We urge that Her X-1 is regularly monitored further and that other X-ray pulsars are investigated for a similar behaviour.   \n",

A cyclotron resonance scattering line at an energy of ~26 keV has been detected in the source spectrum together with its two higher harmonics at ~50 and ~73 keV, respectively. We show that the energy of the line is not constant but changes linearly with the source luminosity. Strong pulse profile variations, especially near the cyclotron line, are revealed for different levels of source intensity. We discuss the obtained results in terms of the theoretical models of X-ray pulsars.   \n",

The explosion fuses a large amount of radioactive <SUP>56</SUP>Ni (refs 1-3). After the explosion, the decay chain from <SUP>56</SUP>Ni to <SUP>56</SUP>Co to <SUP>56</SUP>Fe generates γ-ray photons, which are reprocessed in the expanding ejecta and give rise to powerful optical emission. Here we report the detection of <SUP>56</SUP>Co lines at energies of 847 and 1,238 kiloelectronvolts and a γ-ray continuum in the 200-400 kiloelectronvolt band from the type Ia supernova 2014J in the nearby galaxy M82. The line fluxes suggest that about 0.6 +/- 0.1 solar masses of radioactive <SUP>56</SUP>Ni were synthesized during the explosion. The line broadening gives a characteristic mass-weighted ejecta expansion velocity of 10,000 +/- 3,000 kilometres per second. The observed γ-ray properties are in broad agreement with the canonical model of an explosion of a white dwarf just massive enough to be unstable to gravitational collapse, but do not exclude merger scenarios that fuse comparable amounts of <SUP>56</SUP>Ni.   \n",

In the special case of X-ray-emitting binary pulsars, a direct estimate of the field strength can be obtained by measuring the energy of spectral features that are due to electron cyclotron resonance<SUP>4-13</SUP>. With the Ginga satellite observatory<SUP>14,15</SUP>, we have measured a cyclotron feature in the hard X-ray spectrum of the 1.24-s binary pulsar Hercules X-1 with a much greater energy resolution than in previous observations4-9. The spectrum from 10-60 keV can be described with a simple analytical formula<SUP>12,16,17</SUP>, which indicates an absorption feature at ~34 keV rather than an emission feature at ~50keV. From this we estimate the surface magnetic field strength of Her X-1 to be (2.9+/-0.3) × 10<SUP>12</SUP> G.   \n",

We show that while the phase-averaged and spatially integrated nebula + pulsar spectrum is a power law in this energy band, spatially resolved spectroscopy of the nebula finds a break at ~9 keV in the spectral photon index of the torus structure with a steepening characterized by ΔΓ ~ 0.25. We also confirm a previously reported steepening in the pulsed spectrum, and quantify it with a broken power law with break energy at ~12 keV and ΔΓ ~ 0.27. We present spectral maps of the inner 100'' of the remnant and measure the size of the nebula as a function of energy in seven bands. These results find that the rate of shrinkage with energy of the torus size can be fitted by a power law with an index of γ = 0.094 ± 0.018, consistent with the predictions of Kennel and Coroniti. The change in size is more rapid in the NW direction, coinciding with the counter-jet where we find the index to be a factor of two larger. NuSTAR observed the Crab during the latter part of a γ-ray flare, but found no increase in flux in the 3-78 keV energy band.   \n",

We observed Her X-1 three times, coordinated with Suzaku, during one of the high flux intervals of its 35 day superorbital period. This paper focuses on the shape and evolution of the hard X-ray spectrum. The broadband spectra can be fitted with a power law with a high-energy cutoff, an iron line, and a CRSF. We find that the CRSF has a very smooth and symmetric shape in all observations and at all pulse phases. We compare the residuals of a line with a Gaussian optical-depth profile to a Lorentzian optical-depth profile and find no significant differences, strongly constraining the very smooth shape of the line. Even though the line energy changes dramatically with pulse phase, we find that its smooth shape does not. Additionally, our data show that the continuum only changes marginally between the three observations. These changes can be explained with varying amounts of Thomson scattering in the hot corona of the accretion disk. The average, luminosity-corrected CRSF energy is lower than in past observations and follows a secular decline. The excellent data quality of NuSTAR provides the best constraint on the CRSF energy to date.   \n",

The recipe for calculation of the scattering matrix elements, the differential and total cross sections based on quantum electrodynamic second-order perturbation theory is presented for the case of arbitrary initial and final Landau level, electron momentum along the field and photon momentum. Photon polarization and electron spin state are taken into account. The correct dependence of natural Landau level width on the electron spin state is taken into account in a general case of arbitrary initial photon momentum for the first time. A number of steps in the calculations were simplified analytically making the presented recipe easy to use. The redistribution functions over the photon energy, momentum and polarization states are presented and discussed. The paper generalizes already known results and offers a basis for the accurate calculation of radiation transfer in a strong B field, for example, in strongly magnetized neutron stars.   \n",

We report on the high-energy spectrum of the source, concentrating on cyclotron resonant scattering features. The spectrum is strongly pulse phase dependent, and absorption features are detected at virtually all phases. In particular, four absorption-like features at 12.74, 24.16, 35.74, and 49.5 keV are observed in the descending edge of the main peak of the pulse profile. The ratios between the centroid energies of the lines with respect to the first are 1:(1.9):(2.8):(3.9). These values are close to the harmonic relation expected from cyclotron resonant scattering in a strong magnetic field when relativistic effects are taken into account. The equivalent widths of the second, third, and fourth harmonics are found to be larger than that of the first harmonic, confirming the key role of two-photon processes in the spectral formation. These results provide the first evidence for four harmonically spaced lines in the spectrum of an accreting X-ray pulsar, yielding the clearest confirmation to date of their magnetic origin.   \n",

Observational data covering the outburst brightening phase are analysed in detail for the first time. A comparison of source parameters and their evolution during the brightening and fading phases shows no evidence for any hysteretic behaviour. It is found that the dependences of the energy of the cyclotron absorption line on the luminosity during the brightening and fading phases are almost identical. The complete data sequence including the outburst brightening and fading phases makes it possible to impose the more stringent constraints on the magnetic field in the source. The pulse profile and pulsed fraction are studied as functions of the luminosity and photon energy.   \n",

X-ray spectra of many accreting pulsars exhibit significant variations as a function of flux and thus of mass accretion rate. In some of these pulsars, the centroid energy of the cyclotron line(s), which characterizes the magnetic field strength at the site of the X-ray emission, has been found to vary systematically with flux. <BR /> Aims: GX 304-1 is a recently established cyclotron line source with a line energy around 50 keV. Since 2009, the pulsar shows regular outbursts with the peak flux exceeding one Crab. We analyze the INTEGRAL observations of the source during its outburst in January - February 2012. <BR /> Methods: The observations covered almost the entire outburst, allowing us to measure the source's broad-band X-ray spectrum at different flux levels. We report on the variations in the spectral parameters with luminosity and focus on the variations in the cyclotron line. <BR /> Results: The centroid energy of the line is found to be positively correlated with the luminosity. We interpret this result as a manifestation of the local sub-Eddington (sub-critical) accretion regime operating in the source.   \n",

We report on the detection of three cyclotron resonance features at 27, 51, and 74 keV in the phase-averaged data, corresponding to a polar magnetic field of 2.7×10<SUP>12</SUP> G. After 4U 0115+63, this makes V0332+53 the second accreting neutron star in which more than two cyclotron lines have been detected; this has now also been confirmed by INTEGRAL. Pulse-phase spectroscopy reveals remarkably little variability of the cyclotron line through the 4.4 s X-ray pulse.   \n",

We characterize the spectra quantitatively and built the detailed `three-dimensional' picture of spectral variations with pulse phase and throughout the outburst. We show that all spectral parameters are strongly variable with the pulse phase, and the pattern of this variability significantly changes with luminosity directly reflecting the associated changes in the structure of emission regions and their beam patterns. Obtained results are qualitatively discussed in terms of the recently developed reflection model for the formation of cyclotron lines in the spectra of X-ray pulsars.   \n",

We decompose the X-ray and soft gamma-ray emission of the central part of the Milky Way into relatively compact 'bulge' and more extended 'disc' components and report their spectral properties. The bulge component shows a prominent 511-keV line and essentially no flux at 1.8 MeV, while the disc component on the contrary contains a prominent 1.8-MeV line and a very weak annihilation line. <P />We show that the spectral shape of the annihilation radiation (the narrow 511-keV line and the associated ortho-positronium continuum) is surprisingly well described by a model of annihilation of hot positrons in a radiatively cooling interstellar medium (ISM). The model assumes that positrons are initially injected into a hot (∼10<SUP>6</SUP> K), volume-filling ISM, which is allowed to freely cool via radiative losses. The annihilation time in such a medium is longer than the cooling time for temperatures higher than a few 10<SUP>4</SUP> K. Thus, most of the positrons annihilate only after the gas has cooled down to ∼10<SUP>5</SUP> K, giving rise to annihilation emission characteristic of a warm, ionized ISM.   \n",

We model the material flow in the surface layers of the star by an assumed two-dimensional velocity field satisfying all the physical requirements. Using this model velocity we find that, in the absence of magnetic buoyancy, the surface field is screened (i.e. there is submergence of the field by advection) within the time-scale of material flow of the top layers. On the other hand, if magnetic buoyancy is present, the screening happens over a time-scale that is characteristic of the slower flow of the deeper (and hence, denser) layers. For accreting neutron stars, this longer time-scale turns out to be about 10<SUP>5</SUP>yr, which is of a similar order of magnitude to the accretion time-scale of most massive X-ray binaries.   \n",

High-statistics, intensity-selected spectra were built along 11 years of BAT survey. While the fundamental line is not revealed, the second harmonic of the CRSF can be clearly detected in all the spectra, at an energy varying between ∼53 and ∼58 keV, directly correlated with the luminosity. We have further investigated the evolution of the CRSF in time, by studying the intensity-selected spectra built along four 33-month time intervals along the survey. For the first time, we find in this source a secular variation in the CRSF energy: independent of the source luminosity, the CRSF second harmonic energy decreases by ∼0.36 keV yr<SUP>-1</SUP> between the first and the third time intervals, corresponding to an apparent decay of the magnetic field of ∼3 × 10<SUP>10</SUP> G yr<SUP>-1</SUP>. The intensity-cyclotron energy pattern is consistent between the third and the last time intervals. A possible interpretation for this decay could be the settling of an accreted mound that produces either a distortion of the poloidal magnetic field on the polar cap or a geometrical displacement of the line forming region. This hypothesis seems supported by the correspondence between the rate of the line shift per unit accreted mass and the mass accreted on the polar cap per unit area in Vela X-1 and Her X-1, respectively.   \n",

We report evidence for a clear drop in the observed magnetic field in the accreting pulsar V0332+53 after undergoing a bright 3-month long X-ray outburst. We determine the field from the position of the fundamental cyclotron line in its X-ray spectrum and relate it to the luminosity. For equal levels of luminosity, in the declining phase we measure a systematically lower value of the cyclotron line energy with respect to the rising phase. This results in a drop of ∼1.7 × 10<SUP>11</SUP> G of the observed field between the onset and the end of the outburst. The settling of the accreted plasma on to the polar cap seems to induce a distortion of the magnetic field lines weakening their intensity along the accretion columns. Therefore, the dissipation rate of the magnetic field could be much faster than previously estimated, unless the field is able to restore its original configuration on a time-scale comparable with the outbursts recurrence time.   \n",

Here we present Swift/XRT follow-up observations at the end of those outbursts. Surprisingly, the sources did not decay back to their known quiescent levels but stalled at a (slowly decaying) meta-stable state with luminosities a factor ∼10 above that observed in quiescence. The spectra in these states are considerably softer than the outburst spectra and appear to soften in time when the luminosity decreases. The physical mechanism behind these meta-stable states is unclear and they could be due to low-level accretion (either directly on to the neutron stars or on to their magnetospheres) or due to cooling of the accretion-heated neutron star crusts. Based on the spectra, the slowly decreasing luminosities, and the spectral softening, we favour the crust cooling hypothesis but we cannot exclude the accretion scenarios. On top of this meta-stable state, weak accretion events were observed that occurred at periastron passage and may thus be related to regular type-I outbursts.   \n",

These were acquired during the outburst in June-October 2015. We modeled the observed changes in the spin-frequency of the pulsar and deduced the orbital parameters of the system. We significantly improved existing constrains and show that contrary to previous findings, no change in orbital parameters is required to explain the spin evolution of the source during the outbursts in 1983, 2005, and 2015. The reconstructed intrinsic spin-up of the neutron star during the latest outburst is found to be comparable with previously observed values and predictions of the accretion torque theory.   \n",

All of the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer data acquired in the 2004-2005 outburst were utilized. The 3-80 keV source luminosity varied between 1.7 × 10<SUP>36</SUP> and 3.5 × 10<SUP>38</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>, assuming a distance of 7 kpc. We confirmed that the fundamental cyclotron resonance energy changed from ~22 to ~27 keV, in a clear anti-correlation with the source luminosity and without any hysteresis effects between the rising and declining phases of the outburst. In contrast, the second harmonic energy changed from ~49 to ~54 keV, implying a weaker fractional change as a function of the luminosity. As a result, the observed resonance energy ratio between the second harmonic and the fundamental was ~2.2 when the source was most luminous, whereas the ratio decreased to the nominal value of 2.0 at the least luminous state. Although the significance of this effect is model dependent, these results suggest that the fundamental and second harmonic resonances represent different heights in the accretion column, depending on the mass accretion rate.   \n",

This was found for the pulse phase-averaged line centroid energy using observational data from various X-ray satellites over the time period 1996 to 2012, establishing a reduction of ~4 keV. Here we report on the result of a new observation by NuSTAR performed in August 2015. The earlier results are confirmed and strengthened with respect to both the dependence of E<SUB>cyc</SUB> on flux (it is still present after 2006) and the dependence on time: the long-term decay continued with the same rate, corresponding to a reduction of ~5 keV in 20 yr.   \n",

This instability develops at the onset of accretion, in the thin boundary layer between the accretion disk and neutron star magnetosphere. As a result, the matter collected in the boundary layer can rapidly fall onto the NS surface close to the magnetic poles, but not exactly along the field lines by which the stationary accretion proceeds. This explains the shift in cyclotron line energy measured using RXTE data in a pre-outburst spike, with respect to the line energy observed during the main outburst. Furthermore, the instability can account for the difference in pulse profiles, and their energy evolution that is different in the pre-outburst flare and main outburst.   \n",

Episodic flaring activity is a common feature of X-ray pulsars in HMXBs. In some Be/X-ray binaries flares were observed in quiescence or prior to outbursts. EXO 2030+375 is a Be/X-ray binary showing \"normal\" outbursts almost every ~46 days, near periastron passage of the orbital revolution. Some of these outbursts were occasionally monitored with the INTEGRAL observatory. <BR /> Aims: The INTEGRAL data revealed strong quasi-periodic flaring activity during the rising part of one of the system's outburst. Such activity has previously been observed in EXO 2030+375 only once, in 1985 with EXOSAT. (Some indications of single flares have also been observed with other satellites.) <BR /> Methods: We present the analysis of the flaring behavior of the source based on INTEGRAL data and compare it with the flares observed in EXO 2030+375 in 1985. <BR /> Results: Based on the observational properties of the flares, we argue that the instability at the inner edge of the accretion disk is the most probable cause of the flaring activity.   \n",

The structure and the stability of the magnetosphere, the interaction between the magnetosphere and accreted matter, as well as evolution of neutron star in close binary system are examined within the framework of the two-stream model of nonradial accretion onto a magnetized neutron star. Observable parameters of X-ray pulsars are explained in terms of the model considered.   \n",

The magnetic field is a crucial ingredient of neutron stars. It governs the physics of accretion and of the resulting high-energy emission in accreting pulsars. Studies of the cyclotron resonant scattering features (CRSFs) seen as absorption lines in the X-ray spectra of the pulsars permit direct measurements of the field strength. <BR /> Aims: From an analysis of a number of pointed observations with different instruments, the energy of CRSF, E<SUB>cyc</SUB>, has recently been found to decay in <ASTROBJ>Her X-1</ASTROBJ> , which is one of the best-studied accreting pulsars. We present our analysis of a homogeneous and almost uninterrupted monitoring of the line energy with Swift/BAT. <BR /> Methods: We analyzed the archival Swift/BAT observations of <ASTROBJ>Her X-1</ASTROBJ> from 2005 to 2014. The data were used to measure the CRSF energy averaged over several months. <BR /> Results: The analysis confirms the long-term decay of the line energy. The downward trend is highly significant and consistent with the trend measured with the pointed observations: dE<SUB>cyc</SUB>/ dt ~ -0.3 keV per year. <BR /> Conclusions: The decay of E<SUB>cyc</SUB> either indicates a local evolution of the magnetic field structure in the polar regions of the neutron star or a geometrical displacement of the line-forming region due to long-term changes in the structure of the X-ray emitting region. The shortness of the observed timescale of the decay, -E<SUB>cyc</SUB>/Ė<SUB>cyc</SUB> ~ 100 yr, suggests that trend reversals and/or jumps of the line energy might be observed in the future.   \n",

In July 2015, the high-mass X-ray binary V0332+53 underwent a giant outburst, a decade after the previous one. V0332+53 hosts a strongly magnetized neutron star. During the 2004-2005 outburst, an anti-correlation between the centroid energy of its fundamental cyclotron resonance scattering features (CRSFs) and the X-ray luminosity was observed. <BR /> Aims: The long (≈100 d) and bright (L<SUB>x</SUB> ≈ 10<SUP>38</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>) 2015 outburst provided the opportunity to study the unique properties of the fundamental CRSF during another outburst and to study its dependence on the X-ray luminosity. <BR /> Methods: The source was observed by the INTEGRAL satellite for ~330 ks. We exploit the spectral resolution at high energies of the SPectrometer on INTEGRAL (SPI) and the Joint European X-ray Monitors to characterize its spectral properties, focusing in particular on the CRSF-luminosity dependence. We complement the data of the 2015 outburst with those collected by SPI in 2004-2005, which have so far been left unpublished. <BR /> Results: We find a highly significant anti-correlation of the centroid energy of the fundamental CRSF and the 3-100 keV luminosity of E<SUB>1</SUB> ∝ -0.095(8)L<SUB>37</SUB> keV. This trend is observed for both outbursts. We confirm the correlation between the width of the fundamental CRSF and the X-ray luminosity previously found in the JEM-X and IBIS dataset of the 2004-2005 outburst. By exploiting the RXTE/ASM and Swift/BAT monitoring data, we also report on the detection of a ~34 d modulation superimposed on the mean profiles and roughly consistent with the orbital period of the pulsar. We discuss possible interpretations of such variability.   \n",

This is relevant to the context because the authors aim to study the dependence of the fundamental CRSF on the X-ray luminosity during the 2015 outburst and compare it to the previous outburst.   \n",

The citation is relevant because the paper discusses the spin evolution of the source and compares it to the intrinsic field decay suggested by Cusumano et al. (2016).   \n",
